# SaaSquatch Program Dev CLI

CLI tool for making deployments to Webtask & Contentful easier.

## Installation
TBD

## Usage
Before using you must set up your .env file. See the `.env.example` file to get started.

## TODO
* Fix Webtask login (needs update to pink credit)
* Maybe some code for automatically determining NPM dependencies and telling webtask to install those?
* Add command to view Webtask logs from the CLI
* Be able to set the space by passing a parameter instead of using the list to select
