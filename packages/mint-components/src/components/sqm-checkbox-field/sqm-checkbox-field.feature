    And the password field has valid input
    And the checkbox is not checked
    When they try to register
    Then the checkbox is highlighted in red
    And the error message says "Must be checked"

    Given the register form has the following html
      """
      <sqm-portal-register>
      <sqm-name-fields slot="formData"></sqm-name-fields>
