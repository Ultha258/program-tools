Feature: Big Stat

  Big stat is a component for displaying a statistic as a large number with a label

  @minutia
  Scenario: Demo hook retrieves label using stat pattern
    Given isDemo() returns true
    And the component renders with props:
      | type            |
      | /referralsCount |
    Then the label is: "REFERRALS - COUNT"
    And the value is: "12345"

  @minutia
  Scenario: Demo hook falls back to default label on invalid path
    Given isDemo() returns true
    And the component renders with props:
      | type       |
      | a bad path |
    Then the label is: "Demo Label"
    And the value is: "12345"

  Scenario: Displays error on unrecognized path
    Given isDemo() returns false
    And the component renders with props:
      | type                       |
      | /(doesNotExistNopeNotHere) |
    Then the label is: "BAD PROP TYPE"
    And the value is: "!!!"

  Scenario Outline: Label displays correctly
    Given the type prop is set to <type>
    When the component renders
    Then the label is <label>
    Given isDemo() returns true
    When the component renders
    Then the label is <inferredLabel>
    Examples:
      | path             | label                   | inferredLabel     |
      | rewardsAssigned  | Rewards Earned          | Rewards Assigned  |

    Given isDemo() returns false
    And the user has earned 34 COFFEE from the program
    And the component renders with props:
      | type                                     |
      | /rewardBalance/CREDIT/COFFEE/prettyValue |
    Then the label is: "Balance - Credit Earned"
    And the value is: "34 COFFEE"

  @minutia
  Scenario: Memoizes most recent query
    Given isDemo() returns false
    And the component's type prop is set to a variable named PATH
    And PATH is "/referralsWeek"
    Then the component shows a loading state before showing the result
    When the component reloads given some external reload
    Then the component doesn't show a loading state
    When PATH is set to "/rewardsWeek"
    Then the component shows a loading state before showing the result
    When PATH is set to "/referralsWeek"
    Then the component shows a loading state before showing the result

    Then The stat value displays "..."
    And when the stat query is completed
    And the stat value displays a value

  Scenario: Program context is used by default to source the programId used for queries
    Given a valid "statType"
    And its not a global stat
    And the stat is loaded in an environment for "program-a"
    And the "program-id" prop is not used
    When the stat is queried
    Then the query is filtered by "{ programId_eq: 'program-a' }"
    And only results from "program-a" are returned

  @motivating
  Scenario Outline: ProgramId can be specified to overwrite the program context default
    Given a valid "statType"
    And its not a global stat
    And the "program-id" prop has <value>
    When the stat is queried
    Then the query has a <filter>
    And only results from <value> are returned
    Examples:
      | value     | filter                        |
      | program-b | { programId_eq: "program-b" } |
      | program-c | { programId_eq: "program-c" } |
